Practice makes perfect =)

NOTES:

HEROKU:
- A good time to test deploying to heroku, is after setting up your express server.
- Link to deploying your node.js app to heroku: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#set-up
- Remember to modify 'app.listen' to use 'process.env.PORT' which will be set dynamically by Heroku.
